# COGS — Cognitive Offloading and Getting Stuff Done

COGS is a personal **cognitive management system**: a single application that
captures the full range of a person's working thoughts (reminders, to-dos,
ideas, plans, activity/feeling logs, and reflections) and organizes them into a
small number of interconnected structures — an **Inbox**, **Lists** (categories
and folders), a **Scheduler/Calendar**, **Goals**, **Habits**, **Time
Tracking**, **Modules**, **Reviews**, and **Analytics**.

This repository implements **COGS v1**, evolved toward the **"COGS v2"
specification** (`Cognitive_Management_System_Spec.docx`). See
[`docs/SPEC_MAPPING.md`](docs/SPEC_MAPPING.md) for a section-by-section mapping of
the spec to the code, including what is implemented, partial, or deferred.

> **Documentation convention:** nearly every source file begins with a `/** ... */`
> header explaining its purpose and the spec section(s) it implements, and every
> major folder has a `README.md`. Start with this file, then `docs/SPEC_MAPPING.md`,
> then the folder README nearest the code you're reading.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router) + **React 19**, exported as a fully static site
  (`output: "export"` → `out/`).
- **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **shadcn/ui** (Radix-based primitives in
  `components/ui/`), **lucide-react** icons, **recharts** for Analytics.
- **Windows 95 skin** — global retro chrome via `app/win95.css` (`body.win95-app`);
  Lists panel adds its own Win98 file-manager layer (`components/Lists/filemanager98.css`).
- **Zustand** stores with `persist` middleware for state, currently backed by
  the browser's **localStorage** (the spec calls for migrating this to an
  embedded **SQLite** database — see `docs/SPEC_MAPPING.md` §3).
- **Electron** desktop shell (`electron/`) that serves the static export via a
  custom `app://` protocol. The same build also runs as a plain web app.

## Architecture at a glance

```
Next.js (static export, all client-side)
        │  data persisted via Zustand + localStorage
        │  (+ plan text keys, legacy habit import)
        ▼
out/ (HTML/CSS/JS + public assets)
        │  loaded by
        ▼
Electron main process (electron/main.js)  →  desktop window
```

There is **no server and no API layer** — every feature runs in the renderer and
reads/writes localStorage through the Zustand stores in `lib/` (plus a few direct
localStorage helpers for plan text).

### Application map

```
app/page.tsx
├── Header: Review | Tracking | Inbox | Bulk Add | Quick Add
└── Tabs
    ├── Home ────── Habits | Plan | To Do | Goals | Tracking
    ├── Lists ───── Win98 file manager (folders, lists, items, orb gallery)
    ├── Scheduler ─ Always → Year → Month → Week → Day funnel
    ├── Modules ─── User-composed widgets (list explorer, prompts, …)
    └── Analytics ─ Charts over tasks, habits, points, tracking, reviews
```

Selecting a task from **Lists** opens the full-screen task detail view
(`components/enhanced-task-detail.tsx`).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps   # react-day-picker peer-dep needs this flag
npm run dev                      # web dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run electron:dev             # Next dev server + Electron window
npm run build                    # static export to out/
npm run electron:build           # package desktop installers into dist/
```

## Data layer (summary)

Ten Zustand stores in `lib/` persist to localStorage. Key examples:

| Store | Key | Used for |
|-------|-----|----------|
| `task-store` | `cogs-task-storage` | Tasks, categories, folders |
| `habits-store` | `cogs-habits-store` | Habit definitions + weekly completion data |
| `time-tracking-store` | `cogs-timegrid-store` | TimeGrid scopes, pens, intervals |
| `reviews-store` | `cogs-reviews-store` | Period reviews |
| `lists-ui-store` | `cogs-lists-ui` | Lists UI prefs, orb gallery |

Plan free-text uses `plan-text.ts` helpers (`dayPlan-*`, `weekPlan-*`,
`monthPlan-*` keys). Full file-by-file detail: [`lib/README.md`](lib/README.md).

## Status vs. the v2 spec (summary)

**Implemented in some form:** Inbox / Quick Add / Bulk Add; **Lists** board with
Win98-style folders, custom attributes, orb icons, CSV import, and per-folder All
Items; Scheduler period funnel (Always→Year→Month→Week→Day); Home dashboard
(Habits / Plan / To Do / Goals / Tracking); five habit types with shared
`habits-store`; TimeGrid tracking (header + Home Tracking tab); period **Reviews**
with plan text and reflection; **Modules** dashboard; points on task/habit/goal
completion; Analytics charts.

**Not yet matching the spec** (tracked in `docs/SPEC_MAPPING.md`): SQLite storage
layer + JSON export/import + migrations (§3), unified Item data model with
de-duplicated fields (§5), full Goals→Objectives modeling (§10), complete Reviews
cadence set (§13), Regret accrual (§14), the eight real Analytics views (§15), and
full carry-over logic (§7.7).
